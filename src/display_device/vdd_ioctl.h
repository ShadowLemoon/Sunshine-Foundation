/**
 * @file vdd_ioctl.h
 * @brief Self-contained IOCTL transport for the ZakoVDD control channel.
 *
 * This module is the *forward-looking* transport for VDD commands.
 *
 * Co-existing with it (intentionally, transitionally) is the named-pipe
 * code in `vdd_utils.cpp`. Once every Sunshine release in the wild bundles
 * a driver build that exposes the IOCTL device interface, the pipe code
 * can be deleted in a single mechanical pass — every pipe-only call site
 * in `vdd_utils.cpp` is bracketed with `LEGACY-PIPE` markers.
 *
 * Design rationale: the entire IOCTL implementation lives in its own
 * translation unit (header + cpp), with no contamination of `vdd_utils.cpp`,
 * so the eventual cleanup is "delete pipe code from vdd_utils.cpp; collapse
 * the dispatch wrapper". The IOCTL module does not need to be touched.
